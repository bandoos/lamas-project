Welcome to our project website! 

This projects deals with infromation spreading in a network of agents.

Here is some latex. I still have to find the best way to do latex with Jekyll, but for now:

{% raw %}   
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ 

This is inline $K_{i}\phi$
This is inline \(K_{i}\phi\)
{% endraw %}
